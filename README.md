ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:-
I express my deep sense of gratitude to my respected and learned
guide, Proff. Mariam Jabali Laskar ( Professor of Electronics and Communication
Engineering Department) for her valuable help and guidance.Lastly, I greatly indebted to each and
everybody who has been associated with this project at any stage.üíª

PROBLEM DEFINATION:-
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease
umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery diseases and heart rhythm problems
(arrhythmias).World Health Organization (WHO) research also shows that the most people was dying due to heart disease.
Therefore, This disease can not be taken lightly.

INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVE:-
There are various types of arrhythmias and each type is associated with a pattern,
and as such, it is possible to identify and classify its type.The primary objective is to develop a model for monitoring and
analysis real time signal and to
 develop a system to incprporate the observed data.
As we know that by analyzing or monitoring the ECG signal at initial stage these disease can be prevented.
So I am working in this project.

METHODOLOGY:-
An ECG Sensor with disposable electrodes attaches directly to the chest to detect every heart beat. 
The electrodes of ecg sensor will conversion heart beat to electric signal. ECG Sensors is very light weight, slim and accurately to measures continuous heart beat and give rate data of heart beat.
The sensor assembled on an arm pulse and a leg pulse. All of every sensor electrodes have methods to assemble in body. 

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Hardware :
1)Arduino Uno/Mega/Nano
2)ECG Module (AD8232)
3)ECG Electrodes - 3 pieces
4)ECG Electrode Connector -3.5 mm
5)Power supply- 5V DC battery. 
6)Connecting Wires
Software Requirement :
Arduino IDE
Download from (https://www.arduino.cc)

CONNECTIONS:-
Connection of AD8232 with Arduino:
Arduino 3.3V --------- 3.3V pin
Arduino pin 10 -------- L0+
Arduino Pin 11 -------- L0-
Arduino Analog 1 (A1) ------- Output
Arduino Gnd ----------- Gnd

ECG MODULE (AD8232) SPECIFICATIONS:-
The AD8232 module breaks out nine connections from the IC that you can solder pins, wires, or other connectors to. SDN, LO+, LO-, OUTPUT, 3.3V,
GND provide essential pins for operating this monitor with an Arduino or other development board.

ECG SIGNAL PARAMETER:-
Table Normal ECG Parameters :
Heart rate=(60 - 100) bpm
Phase Duration Amplitude :
PR interval= 0.12 - 0.20 s
QRS interval= ‚â§ 0.12 s
QT interval = < half RR interval (males < 0.40 s; females < 0.44 s)
P wave amplitude (in lead II) = ‚â§ 3 mV (mm)
P wave terminal negative deflection (in lead V1) = ‚â§ 1 mV (mm)
Q wave = < 0.04s

APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE ADVANCEMENTS:-
Applications:
Fitness and activity heart rate monitors.
Portable ECG Remote health monitors.
Biopotential signal acquisition.
Advancements :
Data can be uploaded or directly sent to the doctors by using IOT Technology .
By using more electrodes measurement can be more accurate.

CONCLUSION:-
The real time signal is captured and noise is filtered using the arduino uno and AD8232 sensor.
The works regarding the processing of the heart signals are done.The segmentaion,Filteration,cancellation, classification and the detection of aplitudes of ECG signals are done. 
It was found that the signals of the heart related diseases are all classified on the basis of the P-Q-R peaks in the ECG signal. Data from ongoing large-scale genomic studies will also identify novel drug and genetic targets, leading to the development of new
pharmacological and genetic approaches to the treatment and prevention of arrhythmias.
